# Smart Contracts 101

##### October 10, 2023

# The Modern Blockchain Era

In the beginning of blockchain’s history, Bitcoin was the original trailblazer, conceived as a groundbreaking decentralised monetary system. It was built to forge a path for transparent, secure, and peer-to-peer financial transactions. Yet, as with all technology, time saw the blossoming of blockchain’s capabilities. 

New entrants to the scene, like Solana, didn’t just carry the baton; they revolutionised the space, transforming a blockchain from a ledger of transactions to a potent platform brimming with computational possibilities. Central to this seismic shift are “Smart Contracts” – a term that embodies the merger of tech-based contractual agreements with automated and decentralised execution.

Consider this analogy: The traditional vending machine. You identify your preferred snack, insert the requisite coins, and voila! The machine, abiding by its pre-programmed instructions, delivers your treat. Similarly, smart contracts operate on explicit pre-set conditions and deliver outcomes automatically when those conditions are satisfied.

# The Ascent and Influence of Solana

Visualise Solana as the foundational software, akin to an operating system, powering a realm burgeoning with decentralised applications:

- **Traditional Systems Reimagined:** Picture a world where instead of swiping through Fruit Ninja to pass time, you engage with decentralised apps like StepN, a popular decentralised gamified-fitness app; where bank apps are replaced by decentralised wallets like Phantom. For your financial needs, and investment strategies you go to platforms like Orca instead of centralised fund management apps. These modern alternatives stand apart due to their decentralised nature, eliminating centralised control and the associated risks.

- **The Integral Role of SOL:** SOL isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s the lifeblood of Solana. Its pivotal roles include:
    - Remunerating those who validate and secure the network.
    - Serving as the currency for transaction fees within the network.
    - Facilitating data storage operations.

# Unpacking the Nuances of Smart Contracts

While Bitcoin operates in the realm of straightforward transactions (you either initiate a transfer or you don’t), platforms like Solana, with their advanced architecture, cater to conditional transactions under the stewardship of smart contracts.

**Smart Contracts:** These are intricate computational codes designed to usher in an era of automated contract execution, conditional on specific pre-ordained conditions. See them as digital intermediaries, acting autonomously, without human intervention.

## Functionalities Rooted in Conditionality

Smart contracts can be moulded to serve a vast array of applications. Here are some of the examples of what can be done using smart-contracts:

- **Time-sensitive Transactions:** For instance, Alice might employ a contract to send Bob 10 SOL, but with a caveat that Bob receives it only after a certain duration.
- **Integration with Tangible Triggers:** Envision a future where the insurance sector is infused with smart contract technology. A calamitous event, say a hurricane, could activate a smart contract, ensuring victims receive timely payouts. Such tangible, real-world events can be integrated into blockchain via oracles.
- **Supply Chain Management:** Smart contracts can automatically verify and record each transaction in a supply chain. For example, once a product reaches a specific location, a smart contract could automatically release payment to a supplier.
- **Subscription Services:** Automatic renewals or terminations of subscriptions can be executed based on the terms programmed into the smart contract.
- **Automated Auctions:** decentralised auctions where bids are transparently recorded, and winners are automatically determined based on criteria set in the smart contract.
- **Multi-Signature Wallets:** These wallets require multiple parties to approve a transaction. They can be programmed for business purposes, such as requiring three out of five board members to approve an expenditure.

# Tokens: Types and Functions

**Fungible Tokens:** These tokens emerge from the multifaceted capabilities of smart contracts to oversee and time transactions. Their defining trait is divisibility, with each division retaining identical value. To draw an analogy, a £10 note, which can fragment into 1000 \* 1p coins, showing the trait of fungibility.

**Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs):** Occupying a unique space in the digital token spectrum, NFTs are for the applications that need distinctness as a property. Collections like Okay Bears in Solana (see below) or Ethereum’s Bored Ape Yacht Club are emblematic of NFTs. And while any individual can replicate the aesthetic of an NFT, popularly by “right click save”-ing the art of the NFT, true ownership is authenticated by distinct digital Ids on the blockchain which can’t be duplicated.

NFTs are gaining traction in many sectors, including:

- Digital art repositories
- Digital identity verifications
- Exclusive memberships and event access
- Royalty streams for artists and creators
- Real property rights and even abstract digital domains.

**Storing Art in Pixels and Bytes:** A common misconception is that NFT artwork resides on the blockchain. In reality, due to storage limitations, what the blockchain holds is a unique identifier or a ‘digital signature’ tethered to the artwork. Additional data, perhaps a URL or descriptive metadata, might accompany it, ensuring authentication.

# Decentralised Apps (DApps) and DAOs

**Decentralised Applications:** By amalgamating multiple smart contracts, we are able to create DApps, platforms that function autonomously, eliminating any centralised oversight. Just as we categorise traditional apps (e.g., wellness apps like Calm & Headspace), DApps too inhabit specific niches. 

Decentralised Finance (DeFi), represented by platforms like Mango and Solend in Solana, stands out, showcasing the promise of decentralised trading, and the borrowing and lending of cryptocurrency.

**Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs):** These represent the zenith of decentralisation, creating entities that are driven by community consensus rather than hierarchical structures. DAOs lean heavily on smart contracts to dictate and drive organisational tenets, from decision-making protocols to voting systems. They can serve diverse purposes, from financial platforms to altruistic endeavours like Monkedao.

### **Concluding Reflections**

**Congratulations!** You’ve embarked on and successfully navigated the multifaceted terrains of smart contracts, tokens, NFTs, DApps, and DAOs. Hungry for more knowledge? Excellent. Now consider deepening your insights with our next lesson: Solana 101! As you stand on the verge of blockchain’s future, the horizon is full of possibilities.
