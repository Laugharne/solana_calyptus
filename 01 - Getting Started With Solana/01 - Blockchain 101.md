# Blockchain 101

##### October 9, 2023

In this theoretical module, you’ll get inside the mind of Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin and of blockchain technology. You’ll learn all about how blockchain came into existence, the problems the decentralised technology can solve in today’s world of centralised databases and financial systems, and delve into blockchain’s killer attributes: Security, Speed, Provenance and Low Cost.

Let’s get going…

**How did Bitcoin come to be?**

The story starts with the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 which spurred an anonymous individual named Satoshi Nakamoto to combine his neo-liberal beliefs with his clear genius for technology and cryptography to create a new form of peer-to-peer payment network in 2009. A type of universal financial system which did not need to rely on any kind of financial institution.

**Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?**

Some people think Satoshi might be a man called Nick Szabo who founded a legacy p2p network called BitGold in 1998. His writing style is characteristically similar to the Bitcoin Whitepaper and some theorists have noted that his initials “N.S.” are even the reverse of Satoshi’s “S.N”.  Either way, Nick has refuted ownership and perhaps it truly isn’t him.

In many ways, this leaderless innovation epitomises the organisational wonders of Bitcoin. There is no org chart. No frontman or woman. It operates autonomously and in a decentralised manner – much like how the internet just “exists”.

**What were Satoshi’s reasons?**

After 2008, Mr. Satoshi Nakamoto saw a huge problem in the centralisation of money and the power of banks to be “too big to fail”. Money has been controlled by banks for over 500 years so it’s hard to imagine a financial system built outside of our established banking system.

At the same time, we’ve lived through the financial crisis of 2008, and yet many central banks quickly returned to excessive and loose monetary policies. The Federal Reserve printed 20% of all dollars in existence to manage the impact of Covid-19. 

Some of the questions Satoshi therefore raised were:

- If money can be simply printed, where does its value truly lie?
- Can centralised authorities always be trusted with the fate of our economic well being? 
- Could a universal currency ever operate independently of our banking system?

**What technical problems did Satoshi need to solve?**

**Byzantine Generals Problem
**

To build Bitcoin, Satoshi needed to solve something called the Byzantine Generals Problem. This problem describes the difficulty encountered by siloed parties needing to arrive at consensus with one another without relying on a trusted intermediary. 

How can a group of people agree on the truth of something if they don’t trust each other? 

Which is why we have generals or leaders which often command the “truth”. Or intermediaries, middle-men and custodians which all act as a mutually trusted source between two or more parties.

Banks, governments, social media platforms are such examples of these intermediaries which we rely on today. These entities manage all of our transactions and our exchanges of digital “things” e.g. money and data.

**The Double Spending Problem**

To build Bitcoin, Satoshi also had to solve a second phenomenon called the double-spending problem. It’s a phenomenon we are extremely familiar with: “copy & paste”. Anyone in the digital age has the power to duplicate and spread information infinitely around the world via the internet.

If Alice sends Bob an email, Bob only receives a copy of the email. Not the unique email itself (Alice will have the email safely kept in her Sent Folder). The fact is that data gets replicated, images duplicated, and essays get plagiarised every single day.

Copying & Pasting _is_ the Internet. 

​​However, when it comes to things like assets e.g. money, it’s really important that when Alice sends Bob $100 online, Alice still doesn’t have that money sitting in her account. Hence why we have to trust in intermediaries to keep track of these balances.

And conversely, when it comes to private data, it’s really important that when someone gives a digital entity confidential and material information, that data is not transferred anywhere else. Hence, why we must trust in intermediaries to look after this data.

We trust intermediaries to look after our money and our data because that is how our socio-economy has evolved.

**We Live in a Centralised World**

So we rely on centralised authorities to look after our money and data. On the most part, they actually do a pretty good job!

However, there is often a cost attached to sending, receiving & storing our own digital property. Either it is an expense to us _economically_, or if we are not offered these services, an expense _socially._ The most challenging of all is that the storage of our digital assets are often kept in centralised data centres which are a _huge single point of failure_.

The four key problems of a centralised world:

- **Single points of failure**
- **Monopolization & pricing power**
- **Mismanaged economies**
- **Economic & social Inequality**

**Single Point of Failure**

Database hacks are getting bigger and more frequent. Accenture reports the average cost of cybercrime per attack is $13m and has increased by 72% over the past 5 years. The total of these hacks amounts to $600bn in 2021 alone (0.8% of Global GDP). 

Over the next 5 years, Accenture deems $5.2trillion worth of value for businesses globally to be at risk. The most affected sectors are: Banking, Insurance, Utilities & Software.

As people (the owners of the data) we often do not see the magnitude of the problem first hand. However, all the businesses that we all interact with are consistently under threat. 

Here is a list of the highest breached records in the last few years:

• Comcast (1.5 billion)

• Brazilian resident data leak (660 million)

• Facebook (533 million)

• LinkedIn (500 million)

• Bykea (400 million)

It’s not always about the scale of the initial hack that is the problem. Linkedin’s hack for example was 500m records of scraped professional profiles, not confidential or financial data. However, this data is often used to leverage other things, fake identity for example, to scale larger, costlier attacks on people and their wellbeing.

**Monopolization & High Costs**

**Monopolization**

The most widely-used and adopted payments provider is PayPal, controlling a staggering 50.32% of the payments industry. Its role is to act as a trusted intermediary between two people that do not know each other (Byzantine Generals Problem). 

The problem is that business owners often lose up to 4% of every sale just when a customer chooses to transact via PayPal. It’s an easy option for consumers because it’s fast, but these margins are able to significantly affect the bottom line of business owners, big and small.

**High Costs:**

In certain parts of the world, it can cost up to 10% in transaction fees to send money from one place to the other. If sending information e.g. a text message costs close to zero then why is sending a transaction (quite literally numbers on a screen) in a secure and efficient manner so expensive? There is a major opportunity for a universal solution to improve the financial processes for sending/receiving money globally.

**Mismanaged Economies**

Many developing economies cannot trust their government’s monetary management such as Venezuela, Sudan or Argentina. Holding their national currency can be futile. 

Argentina has been suffering with hyperinflation for over 30 years. The country was plunged into a devastating economic crisis in 2002 as a result of abandoning the peso’s fixed exchange rate with the US dollar. In 2022, the country’s inflation rate reached 88%. All directly attributed to poor political leadership and economic management.

In Venezuela, the government headed by Nicolás Maduro declared a state of emergency in 2016. He and his predecessors had left the country’s economy vulnerable due to a long-standing overreliance on oil for economic growth. The country’s inflation rate reached 1,000,000% in 2018. Over three million people fled the country in 2019 to escape the turmoil.

Even with the management of developed economies, the consequence of The Federal Reserve printing 20% of the US’s money supply post-Covid led to sky-rocketing inflation. The loose money printing like this from governments to soften Covid’s true economic effects has potentially stalled an even deeper global recession, simply pushed into the future.

**Economic & Social Inequality**

For many people in the world, banking is not even a reality. The IMF has estimated that there are a staggering 1.7bn unbanked adults in the world. 

Banks have the control over who does or does not get a bank account i.e. who can and cannot have the right to store their money, send money to friends & family or gain interest on their savings. 

In countries like Kenya, it’s easier to buy goods and services using mobile credit than from a bank account. The country uses a company called M-Pesa to do so. It has over 50 million users.

**So what is Blockchain?**

Blockchain is the underlying technology that was first invented to power Bitcoin. Since its discovery however, its technology has been found to be capable of a lot more.

_It is a high-security distributed ledger technology which can be programmed to track and record anything of value._ 

Blockchain as it sounds is quite literally a chain of blocks which timestamp the state of a ledger at regular intervals. If you want to make a change to a block, you don’t rewrite that particular block. Instead, you add a new transaction to the latest block to update the ledger (e.g. debit 1 BTC from Alice’s account and credit 1 BTC to Bob’s).

Not only are blocks chained together chronologically but the blockchain (and its ledger) is distributed across many hundreds of thousands, if not millions of computers, which gives it incorruptible security without a single point of failure. Whilst peer-to-peer distribution is not new, its combination with cryptography is, which offers a solution to a whole new spectrum of use cases.

**Blockchain is the “Trust Protocol”**

For the first time in history people are able to:

- Transact and contribute to a shared ledger of information whilst,
- Being able to trust the ledger will always be true

Ultimately, replacing the need for middlemen or custodians. 

**Permissionless vs Permissioned**

There are two main types of blockchain:

**Permissionless (Public)**

If the blockchain is maintained by people that don’t know or trust each other (like Bitcoin) then it’s permissionless. For permissionless blockchains, you need an incentive for certain people to help keep the ledger up to date and secure e.g. payment in BTC. 

These people are called miners (or on Ethereum, validators) and it is their computers (nodes) that maintain and update the blockchain.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/imavXOwTf2JFR87nVRlKLEAnBBu8GvT76Fott0QUBSbhD-yk_fMhNlRi-z-SVcq5yFlOY2OxcrvSlw0mCT7rRmTgxcAepDnORHMQ7NB0fqvhGNGiXBXc-D4QaXQPibVqigQfHdJJALS3vDF_VdTNNbA)

**How do they work?**

Well, say someone wants to send money on the bitcoin network, they are requesting a change to this shared ledger (-1 BTC from Alice’s account, +1BTC to Bob’s account). 

So Alice sends this transaction request which propagates globally across millions of computers (mining computers) which each have their own copy of the bitcoin network. Now, these validators all start adding the transaction with all other transactions happening on the network in a competition to create the next block on the blockchain. 

The network itself operates on a consensus mechanism called “Proof of Work”. Effectively, a mechanism in which computers each exert high-computational power to try and solve a very complex puzzle via trial & error (much like trying billions and billions of keys to unlock a treasure chest).

In the case of Bitcoin, the difficulty of the puzzle is moderated to ensure the answer is found approximately every 10 minutes, hence a new block of transactions is created roughly every 10 minutes. The winning miner is rewarded in Bitcoin (6.25BTC to be exact) – a reward which is halved every four years.

The winner shares their block with the rest of the bitcoin network, so the other miners can verify they did in fact win “fair and square”, and their block is added to the blockchain. The cryptography behind this process, which makes the “chain” in blockchain, will be discussed in subsequent lessons.

Overall, it is important to note that the system is only secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more mining power (51%) than any cooperating group of attacker nodes. While theoretically this is possible, in practice, it would be _almost impossible_ for a single entity to gain control of that much hash rate simultaneously.

**Permissioned**

For networks where trust already exists between the maintainers of the network, we call these permissioned blockchains. They often do not need incentives for people (or miners) to foster this trust between users.

**How does it work?**

As an example, perhaps you are the World Trade Organisation and internally to avoid having any single point of failure for all trade agreements & records, can have all your records stored securely and maintained across many different computers.

However, it is important to note that permissioned blockchains still have not been proven yet to be better than traditional server systems in terms of cost, efficacy or security. At present, the decentralisation of _permissionless_ blockchains is where the real value and disruption is being found. Hence, why we are teaching Solidity (the programming language of Ethereum) & Rust (the programming language of Solana).

**In A Decentralised World…**

There are four crucial qualities that blockchain can provide:

- **Security,** 
- **Speed,** 
- **Provenance,**
- **Low-cost**

**Security**

Blockchains are able to be much safer databases than centralised ones which are prone to hacks and scams. In 2021, it cost businesses $600bn globally due to centralised databases being compromised. 

Only 2% of these hacks were crypto-related, but there is a key aspect to discern here. All of these hacks happening in Web3 today are at the _execution_ (smart contract) layer, not the _protocol_ (blockchain) layer, due to human error i.e. bad code.

This is why Calyptus exists. To help train up & place experienced software engineers like yourself into Web3 to ensure higher-quality smart contracts. The industry is relying on it..!

**Speed**

Blockchains are becoming incredibly fast and competitive with traditional banking systems. Visa is able to process c. 1,700 transactions per second, while blockchains like Solana can process up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), with an average daily usage of 4000 TPS. 

Ethereum comparatively looks like a snail’s pace, only 15 transactions per second. It has to use scaling solutions, called Layer-2 blockchains, to try to enable similar levels of volume.

**Provenance**

Blockchains enable provenance. Every block in the blockchain is cryptographically strung together using the hash of the previous block (something we will cover in the upcoming lessons). What this means is that any transaction or exchange can be irrefutable mapped back to an exact period of time.

In Bitcoin’s case, all the way back to Block 0 (the genesis block) you can trace back when every single transaction occurred over time. This proof of events can be highly valuable across all different types of industries including supply chain, real estate, law & healthcare.

For example:

- Ownership history of assets e.g. art, real estate or land deeds
- Supply chain tracking e.g. Walmart used blockchain as a food tracking system resulting in invoice disputes decreasing from 70% to less than 1%.

- Authenticity and sustainability tracking e.g. De Beers launched a blockchain-based platform which has the capability to provide provenance assurance for 100% of De Beers’ diamonds from source all the way through to shop floor.

The next steps for companies like Walmart or DeBeers would be to use permissionless blockchains to publicly prove sustainability (so they are not key maintainers of their own network).

**Low Cost**

At present, it’s not super cheaper to send crypto such as Bitcoin or Ethereum compared to traditional finance systems. The maturity of blockchain technology today has been compared to the internet in the 1980s! 

Drastic economic or social cost reduction will take time (you are in the top 1% of software engineers who are at the start of understanding this tech frontier).

Today, the average cost is $1-2 to send Bitcoin and $4-6 to send Ethereum to anyone in the world with a computer/smartphone and internet connection. 

Solana however is considerably cheaper! Solana transactions only cost a few cents to send crypto to anyone in the world.

In the future, the evolution of blockchain technology will reach a stage where sending any digital asset will cost virtually 0 via payment rails not controlled by existing financial institutions.

**Well Done!**

You’ve just learnt about all-things blockchain and taken your first steps down the Web3 rabbit hole. In summary, blockchain offers many exciting possibilities for a new world! With its inherent security, speed, provenance, and potential cost-saving features, blockchain is becoming increasingly relevant across industries from finance to identity.

It is essential to recognise that we are still at the early stages of its development, and the true impact of this transformative technology is yet to be fully realised! As we journey further into the world of blockchain and its applications, we will witness its potential to reshape products, business structures and even whole economies. We’re still so early.
